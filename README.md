This platform will help the students share their notes and retrieve them.Users can securely register and log in to their individual accounts, and upload, view, download notes. Users can share their documents (both handwritten notes and documents inÂ PDF, DOC, and PPT) access by other users in any subject or course. Users can post their notes to our website along with a brief description and a few keywords referring to the subject, Field. This project also aims for providing a digital platform for the users where they can request notes as required and another user of this same platform can supply that notes to the requesting user and can also search notes. Multiple users can work in this system at the same time under centralized administration. This project also assists with administrative tasks such as notes and user management.
